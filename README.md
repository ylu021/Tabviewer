# What it is  

This is a simple Chrome Extension for showing tab names. 

Its sole purpose is to reduce the time finding the tab you need, by having them displayed on a small window, the current opened tabs can be easily navigated and clickable. 
(see screenshot)  

I hope people can contribute to this simple plugin, to make it better and save some time browsing on tabs :)
